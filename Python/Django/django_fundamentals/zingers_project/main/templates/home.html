                    <p>Welcome to Zinger's Homemade Ice Cream. We are Randy and Delilah Reed, new owners of Zinger’s Homemade Ice Cream. It’s been a family tradition to vacation at the Oregon Coast and one of our favorite places to go was Zinger’s. We have two children, Brittney and Brennen, and one grandson. We became engaged 30 years ago at Ecola State Park and have always dreamed of owning a business at the Oregon Coast. With our passion for food and serving people, Zinger's is more than just an ice cream shop. We’ve created a space that allows you and your family to spend time together and make memories. You'll be able to enjoy modern day conveniences and reminisce about the beach time past. We strive to create more than just awesome ice cream, we want to build a community of people who enjoy spending time with friends and family. Our shop is a place where you can connect with those you love while enjoying pure, tasty goodness!</p>
